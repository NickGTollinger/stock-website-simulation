# stock-website-simulation
Developed as part of my CS50 class over the Summer of 2023. Utilizes SQL, Flask, and Python in allowing users to buy simulated stocks, add cash to their account, and simulate stock growth and decay

The full scale of functionalities of this website include: Account registration/log-in, buying/selling stocks, view purchase and sell history (with such info being stored in a the finance database), search for quote of specific stock, add balance to account, etc. The layout of the website utilized HTML and jinja, but
it's important for me to note that the layout.html, helpers.py and apology.html is not my work, however, everything else I did myself. I made sure to understand every resource I used and what purpose it should serve.
